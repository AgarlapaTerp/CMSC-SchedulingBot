# CMSCSchedulingBot
This is a chatbot built using python specifically natural processing and deep learning to help fellow Terps in their scheduling process

The app.py file is the main file with the GUI coded in. Running this file will start up the entire chatbot. The misinput.txt file is meant for any 
messages that the chatbot may not be able to understand. The intents.json is the blueprint responses that the chatbot will follow when talking to it. 
The train.py file is the training file for the Chatbot's deep learning, and the chatbotTHREE.py file is the response generator. nltkUtils.py is used 
for its functions in the chatbotTHREE.py file.

The first step to run the chatbot is to make sure nltk, tkinter, model, torch and numpy are downloaded onto pycharm. 

After that, make sure you run all of the python files once to load the functions and training. 

The last step is to run app.py and reap the benefits of this glorious bot!!!


P.S make sure to run the train.py file before the app.py file to train the bot. The console will let you know when the training is complete.
