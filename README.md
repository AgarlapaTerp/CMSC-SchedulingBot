# CMSCSchedulingBot
This is a chatbot built using python specifically natural processing and deep learning to help fellow Terps in their scheduling process

The app.py file is the main file with the gui coded in. Running this file will start up the entire chatbot. The misinput.txt file is meant for any 
messages that the chatbot may not be able to understand. The intents.json is the blueprint responses that the chatbot will follow when talking to it.

P.S you may have to run the train.py file before the app.py file to train the bot. The console will let you know when the training is complete.
